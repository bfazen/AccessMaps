# Offline Maps Application for CHWs

This version seeks to reduce the feature set and simplify the user interface of existing offline maps applications. 
The intent is for distribution to Community Health Workers with little prior exposure to the Android platform, and the interface is targeted to be accessible to first time smart phone users.  I have limited the more complex touch gestures and menu settings, and taken away the options to import and download data, show traffic overlays, etc. etc.  OpenStreetMap and KML files are autoamtically imported from the SD in order to allow for simple field installation and minimal device management.
